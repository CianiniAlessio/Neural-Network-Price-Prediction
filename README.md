# Neural-Network-Price-Prediction

In this program I'm going to create a client that will be used to retrieve the data from binance of BTC.
These data will be used to train a NN model with 3 input and one output (The forecast of the price).
The 3 inputs are decided by me, and are not necessarly the best one.
At the end of the file there is a while cycle in which I do the backtest to see how it would actually work in real time.
I'll retrieve the last price of btc thanks to the client, and then I wait 'x' minutes to see how it would have performed.
